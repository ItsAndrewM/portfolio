    "Hello! My name is Andrew McMillan and I love programming and creating things.  Right now, I'm enjoying making things that live on the internet but I also like dabbling in creating programs and interfaces that live on your desktops.  I got into computer science and programming in 2020 after a career in Sport and Fitness leadership and haven't looked back since, but also there was a pandemic and like many I contemplated all my life choices.  But here we are, 'thriving'.  I got into web development in 2022 and have been loving developing full-stack applications and web-sites since.",

My main focus these day is building interesting, fun, fast and unique client and customer experiences for an industry that hasn't seen a technological shift since radar was invented.",
